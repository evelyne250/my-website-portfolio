        <p>My names are evelyne umuhire, i am 21 years old i am curently studying two things at a time. That is coding and finance which can be very unrelated to some people especially my parents, but coding is something i like very much and i'm looking forward to be apart of and i'm starting to get it. 
            Am a very courageous person, if i want something i work very hard to achieve it. Failure doesn't make me give up it gives me courage to work very hard to prevent failing again.</p>
